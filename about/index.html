From an early age, he loved to listen and make music, be it his mother singing lullabies or his father listening to his favorite rock band. This instilled a life-long love of music in Joe, leading to him joining several ensembles in middle school and high school. During high school, Joe had several amazing teachers, both music and non-music teachers, that pushed him to study to be a music teacher. Joe went on to enroll at Grove City College as a music education major in the fall of 2017. Since then, he has held several different leadership positions in different collegiate ensembles. These positions include music librarian, secretary, and student conductor. Joe is also the principle bassist in the collegeâ€™s Symphony Orchestra, and principle tuba in the Concert Band. After graduating from Grove City College in May of 2021, Joe plans on attending graduate school to earn a Master of Music in Music Technology, focusing on electronic music production.</p><br><p id="phil">Outside of music, Joe enjoys spending time outside in nature as well as learning the basics of computer software development. He has written several programs that are freely available and have a small but strong user base. Joe hopes to one day combine his love for music with his love of computers in a way to make music more accessible for students that have a lower socioeconomic status and those with special needs.</p><br></div><br><img src="/pictures/face2.JPG" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" height="500" width="650" alt="A headshot of Joe Diamond"><br><br></div><br><!-- Insert content above these p tags --><p id="comm">Questions and comments can be directed to <a href="mailto: info@jdiamondmusic.com"><em>info@jdiamondmusic.com</em></a></p><p id="comm">This site is powered by <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a></p>
